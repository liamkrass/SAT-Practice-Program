A line of best fit is drawn through the data points. The y-intercept is at approximately 60. A) The predicted score of a student who studied for 0 hours. B) The predicted score of a student who studied for 10 hours. C) The predicted increase in score for each additional hour of study. D) The predicted number of hours of study for a student who scored 0.
